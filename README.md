# EN2533_Robot_Design_and_Competition
This repository contains all the codes written by our team members for the final robotics competition of EN2533 Robot Design and Competition module.

As a partial fulfilment for the EN2533 Robot Design and Competiton module, we were to develop a mobile robot which is able to perform specific tasks. You can find the task sheet [here.](Robotic_Task_version_1_1-8.pdf)

Below are some of the photographs of our robot. ![WhatsApp Image 2023-12-11 at 10 01 40 PM](https://github.com/YasodaLAE/EN2533_Robot_Design_and_Competition/assets/112842373/4d49ad86-eb93-4c11-a971-e7a4647fb2cb)
