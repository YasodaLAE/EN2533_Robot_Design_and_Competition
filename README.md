# EN2533_Robot_Design_and_Competition
This repository contains all the codes written by our team members (Yasoda Lasiru, Yaseema Rusiru, Ravija Dulnath, Methsara Shamika, Lahiru Cooray) for the final robotics competition of EN2533 Robot Design and Competition module.

As a partial fulfilment for the EN2533 Robot Design and Competiton module, we were to develop a mobile robot which is able to perform specific tasks. You can find the task sheet [here.](Robotic_Task_version_1_1-8.pdf)

Below are some of the photographs of our robot. ![WhatsApp Image 2023-12-11 at 10 01 40 PM](https://github.com/YasodaLAE/EN2533_Robot_Design_and_Competition/assets/112842373/4d49ad86-eb93-4c11-a971-e7a4647fb2cb)
